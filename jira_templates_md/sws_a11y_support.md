## Level of SWS support:
Note that all sites have Siteimprove monitoring.

* No help - this is a one-time request.
* Facilitated help - SWS will fix minor issues and, when necessary, meet with content editors to help fix bigger issues and discuss best practices.
* Comprehensive support - When SWS is responsible for the majority of site building, SWS will provide updates,
  fix minor issues, and meet with site owners to address bigger issues.
