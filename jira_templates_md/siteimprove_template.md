## 1. Get the site info
To request Siteimprove scanning you‚Äôll need:

1. **School, Department, or Office** - Check org code (https://web.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/budget/org/orgchart/)

1. **Production URL** (If the site is not launched, this will be the eventual URL.)

1. **Build URL** (Where the new site-to-be-launched is getting built.)

1. **Site owners** (names and emails) who will be using Siteimprove
2. **Optional: information about the site**, for example: "This is a sandbox site and that it will not have an associated production URL."

## 2. Ask site owners to create accounts on Siteimprove
Site owners log into Siteimprove to create their account.

### üìß Send email, Subject: Create your account on Siteimprove for site-name

As part of our site building, we now set up SiteImprove for all websites. This will allow you to monitor the accessibility of your site, and it will also help with things like broken links and typos.¬†To learn more about Siteimprove, visit https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/testing/siteimprove.

To give you access to the reports, if you haven‚Äôt already, you will need to create your account by logging into SiteImprove. Please log onto https://siteimprove.stanford.edu, and then let us know you have done so. Then, we can set you up with access to reports for your site.


## 3. Create Siteimprove entry

Is there an existing entry in Siteimprove for this site? If so, can we just update the existing entry?

Once the production site has been provisioned, here are directions for creating a Siteimprove entry:

## 4. Inform site owners when their Siteimprove is ready with their site

üìß ODA will send out an email immediately after requesting the site. However, it can be several days before the scan of the site is complete. When the Siteimprove report is complete, here's an email template to send to the site owner:

---
### üìß Send email, Subject: Siteimprove report for site-name is ready!

Dear Site Owner,

Siteimprove has scanned your site and the reports are ready. Please log into https://siteimprove.stanford.edu and select this site from the dropdown menu at the top of your dashboard.  For tips on using Siteimprove go to https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/siteimprove. You can ask questions at the #cop-siteimprove slack channel.¬†

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: SiteImprove is scanning a copy of your site. Please make changes on the production site.**
