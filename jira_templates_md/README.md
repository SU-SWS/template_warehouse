# Jira Templates

The files in this directory are meant to be used as templates for things in Jira, e.g., bug reports

Jira descriptions and comments use [Jira's *Markdown*](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/markdown-and-keyboard-shortcuts/)

For this repo, we're storing these templates as .md files. To use these templates, you can either copy and paste the template contents into the description field of your Jira ticket, or you can clone existing tickets.
